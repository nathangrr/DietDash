# DietDash

Overview: Fully functional iOS application to track diet trends, set diet goals, view diet progress, and customize daily/weekly objectives. The goal of this app is to motivate a healthy and streamlined diet for the user to achieve a desirable wellbeing.

Notice: Compatible ONLY with a 9.7 inch iPad during alpha phase.

Future Features: 
1) Will have the ability to add more than 6 daily goals. Will also add "scrolling" to the login page
2) Compatibility for all iPad sizes
3) The ability to add/remove goals at any point in the week without affecting the final progress. For example, if a goal is added on Thursday, then the progress bar Maximum Value will only go up by 20 instead of 35
4) Track previously weekly progress, view more important feedback
5) Database connectivity to store user data (as opposed to UserDefaults at the moment)

NOTE: Version 1.0 on the App Store will only add Future Feature number 2

NOTE: Version 1.1 on the App Store will add features 1, 3

NOTE: Version 1.2 on the App Store will greatly expand the usability of the app and add Future Features 5 and 6

NOTE: An ambiguous version (such as 1.1.1, 1.2.1, etc) will add compatibility with iPhone. This is a more minor effort at the moment, as I would like to make the app more feauture complete before expanding to other devices. 

Please provide feedback to nathanranthony@gmail.com about other bug fixes and recommendations. Thanks!
