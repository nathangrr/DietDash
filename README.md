# DietDash

Fully functional iOS application to track diet trends, set diet goals, view diet progress, and customize daily/weekly objectives. The goal of this app is to motivate a healthy and streamlined diet for the user to achieve a desirable wellbeing.

Currently ONLY compatible with iPad. Will set constraints for other devices in coming days.

Next (major) update will add Google Authentication support (as opposed to just UserDefaults). 

Further enhancements will be posted in the coming days. Recommend testing on a 9.7 inch iPad until full compatibility is added.
