# DietDash

Fully functional iOS application to track diet trends, set diet goals, view diet progress, and customize daily/weekly objectives. The goal of this app is to motivate a healthy and streamlined diet for the user to achieve a desirable wellbeing.

Next update will add Google Authentication support (as opposed to just UserDefaults). 

Further enhancements will be posted in the coming days.
