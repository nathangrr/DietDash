# DietDash

Overview: Fully functional iOS application to track diet trends, set diet goals, view diet progress, and customize daily/weekly objectives. The goal of this app is to motivate a healthy and streamlined diet for the user to achieve a desirable wellbeing.

User notice: Currently ONLY compatible with 9.7 inch iPad. Will set constraints for other devices in coming days.

Future updates: Next (major) update will add Google Authentication support (as opposed to just UserDefaults). 

Known bugs:
1) Weekly progress date is incorrect
