*************

Features:
1) The user creates an account locally on their device. Up to 6 objectives can be created along with their respective goals
2) The 'goal' of the app is to accumulate enough progress points each week to fill the progress bar. Points can be obtained from completing daily objectives.
3) Boosts can also be utilized to gain more progress points. Up to 3 boosts can be used a day. They are randomized.
4) At the end of the week (on Sunday), if the progress bar is filled to 100%, then 1/30 spaces will be filled in the Road Map
5) Once 30 weeks are complete, the roadmap is complete and the 'dash' can be restarted.
6) (First week only) When a user first creates an account, progress points are automatically added to the progress bar to fill in the days of the week that were missed. This ensures the user is still able to finish for the week.
